# Dementia Detection from Brain Scans using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect dementia from brain scans using a machine learning model based on the Inception V3 algorithm. The model is trained to analyze brain scan images and provide predictions about the presence of dementia. The project includes both a web application for user interaction and a machine learning backend for inference.
