# Dementia Detection from Brain Scans using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect dementia from brain scans using a machine learning model based on the Inception V3 algorithm. The model is trained to analyze brain scan images and provide predictions about the presence of dementia. The project includes both a web application for user interaction and a machine learning backend for inference.

## Introduction

This project aims to detect dementia from brain scans using a machine learning model based on the Inception V3 algorithm. Dementia is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient care and quality of life. By leveraging machine learning techniques and medical imaging, we seek to provide a reliable tool for identifying potential cases of dementia from brain scan images.

## Scope and Requirements

### Scope

- Develop a machine learning model using Inception V3 for classifying brain scan images as indicative of dementia or not.
- Implement a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to upload brain scan images for analysis.
- Utilize Django as the backend framework to manage user interactions, model inference, and data processing.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- TensorFlow (for the Inception V3 model)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend
- An internet browser for accessing the web application
- Brain scan images for testing and validation

## Design

The project consists of two main components: the frontend web interface and the backend machine learning model.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. Users can access the web application through a browser, upload brain scan images, and receive predictions regarding the presence of dementia. The interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the underlying machine learning model.

### Backend

The backend is powered by Django, a robust web framework. It manages user requests, handles image uploads, processes data, and interacts with the machine learning model. The machine learning model, based on Inception V3, is responsible for analyzing brain scan images and generating predictions. It leverages TensorFlow for efficient image classification.
